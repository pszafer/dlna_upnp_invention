DLNA UPNP Server is application written in Python to share media 
with all important hardware producer, which cooperate with UPnP or DLNA.

It will work under Linux hardware, this means PC (Ubuntu, Debian), routers (Tomato, DD-WRT).
Probably other too, but it wouldn't be tested

It is based on modified Coherence framework.
I want to thank You authors of Coherence framework for their job because 
without Coherence I wouldn't wrote this application.

For them, if they want they could get modified/corrected coherence.

It is licenced under the BSD licence except Coherence, which is still under MIT licence.

You are welcome to invent some original name for this app.
